# SCT_WD_2

## Project Overview  
SCT_WD_2 is a web development project built during my internship at SkillCraft Technology. It’s a functional and responsive stopwatch application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Why this project?   
- To reinforce skills in state management (start/pause/reset), timer logic and DOM updates.  
- To build a deployable web utility that demonstrates clean code structure and design.  
- To learn how to organize assets and scripts in a maintainable folder structure.

## Built With  
- HTML
- CSS (including responsive layout)  
- JavaScript  
- Folder structure:  
  - `css/` – Stylesheets  
  - `js/` – JavaScript files  
  - `assets/` – audio  
  - `index.html` – Entry point  

## Features  
- Start, Pause/Resume, and Reset functionality for the stopwatch.  
- Lap recording to track intervals.  
- Clean, semantic markup and responsive layout for mobile & desktop.  
- Lightweight, dependency-free codebase.
- sound effects while running and recording laps.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
- A local development environment (optional, you can simply open `index.html`)
